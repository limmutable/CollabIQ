- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality Review

✅ **No implementation details**: Specification focuses on WHAT needs to be documented and cleaned up, not HOW to implement it. No mention of specific tools, scripts, or code patterns.

✅ **Focused on user value**: All user stories frame the work from developer/maintainer perspective and articulate clear value (consistency, navigability, reduced confusion).

✅ **Written for non-technical stakeholders**: Language is accessible. Terms like "file naming conventions," "audit," and "cleanup" are clear without technical jargon.

✅ **All mandatory sections completed**: User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria, Assumptions, Out of Scope present and complete.

### Requirement Completeness Review

✅ **No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers**: All requirements are concrete with no ambiguity markers.

✅ **Requirements are testable and unambiguous**:
- FR-001: Can verify constitution.md contains naming standards section ✓
- FR-002: Can verify all file categories are covered ✓
- FR-003: Can verify each rule has format, examples, rationale ✓
- FR-004: Can verify audit document exists and is comprehensive ✓
- FR-005: Can verify severity categories are used ✓
- FR-006: Can verify each finding has all required attributes ✓
- FR-007: Can verify Critical/High processed first via commit history ✓
- FR-008: Can verify git mv was used via git log ✓
- FR-009: Can verify imports updated by running code ✓
- FR-010: Can verify tests still pass ✓

✅ **Success criteria are measurable**:
- SC-001: Can count file categories covered in constitution.md ✓
- SC-002: Can count remaining Critical/High severity issues (target: 0) ✓
- SC-003: Can measure compliance rate in code reviews (target: 100%) ✓
- SC-004: Can measure file location time (target: <30s) ✓
- SC-005: Can verify test pass rate (target: 0 failures) ✓
- SC-006: Can verify audit document has severity ratings and effort estimates ✓

✅ **Success criteria are technology-agnostic**: No mention of specific tools, frameworks, or implementation approaches. Criteria focus on outcomes like "developer can locate files" and "tests continue to pass."

✅ **All acceptance scenarios are defined**: 11 total acceptance scenarios across 3 user stories covering the full workflow from documentation → audit → cleanup.

✅ **Edge cases are identified**: 5 edge cases covering naming conflicts, import complexity, Git history, Python conventions, and SpecKit framework conflicts.

✅ **Scope is clearly bounded**: Out of Scope section explicitly excludes SpecKit changes, ecosystem config files, other branches, automated linting, architecture changes, and Python standard files.

✅ **Dependencies and assumptions identified**:
- Dependencies: Constitution v1.0.0, stable structure, clean repo, passing tests
- Assumptions: Python conventions, SpecKit standards, English naming, ecosystem configs

### Feature Readiness Review

✅ **All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria**: Each FR has corresponding acceptance scenario in user stories demonstrating how it will be verified.

✅ **User scenarios cover primary flows**:
- P1: Document standards (foundation)
- P2: Audit current state (analysis)
- P3: Apply fixes (implementation)
This covers the complete workflow in logical order.

✅ **Feature meets measurable outcomes**: All 6 success criteria map directly to functional requirements and can be objectively measured.

✅ **No implementation details**: Specification avoids mentioning specific Python libraries, git commands (beyond git mv for Git history preservation), or implementation patterns.

## Notes

- Specification is complete and ready for planning phase (`/speckit.plan`)
- No clarifications needed - all requirements are concrete and actionable
- The feature has clear incremental value: P1 alone (documentation) provides immediate benefit
- Edge cases are well-considered, especially regarding Git history and Python ecosystem conventions
- Success criteria provide clear definition of done for each phase

## Recommendation

**✅ APPROVED FOR PLANNING** - Specification meets all quality criteria and is ready for `/speckit.plan` phase.
