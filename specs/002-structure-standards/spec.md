# Feature Specification: Project Structure Standards & File Naming Convention

**Feature Branch**: `002-structure-standards`
**Created**: 2025-10-29
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "analyze and clean up project structure and documents. add file naming rules in constitution.md with the best practices for this project."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Establish File Naming Standards (Priority: P1)

As a developer working on CollabIQ, I need clear file naming conventions documented in the constitution so that all team members follow consistent naming patterns and can easily locate files.

**Why this priority**: Without naming conventions, the codebase becomes disorganized as different developers use inconsistent naming patterns (camelCase vs snake_case, varying prefixes, unclear abbreviations). This is foundational for all future work.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by reviewing the updated constitution.md and verifying that all naming rules are documented with examples. Delivers immediate value by providing a reference guide for all future file creation.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a developer needs to create a new specification file, **When** they consult constitution.md, **Then** they find clear naming rules for specs (e.g., `###-feature-name/spec.md`)
2. **Given** a developer needs to create a new test file, **When** they consult constitution.md, **Then** they find clear naming rules for tests organized by type (unit, integration, contract)
3. **Given** a developer needs to create a new module, **When** they consult constitution.md, **Then** they find clear naming rules for Python packages and modules (snake_case, descriptive names)
4. **Given** a developer needs to create documentation, **When** they consult constitution.md, **Then** they find clear naming rules for docs (SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE for major docs, descriptive kebab-case for guides)

### User Story 2 - Audit Current Project Structure (Priority: P2)

As a project maintainer, I need a comprehensive analysis of the current project structure identifying inconsistencies and areas for improvement so that I can prioritize cleanup efforts.

**Why this priority**: Before making changes, we need to understand what's wrong. This creates the roadmap for User Story 3.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by reviewing the analysis document that lists all structural issues with severity ratings. Delivers value by creating visibility into technical debt without requiring any code changes.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the current project structure exists, **When** the audit is performed, **Then** all file naming inconsistencies are documented with locations
2. **Given** the audit is complete, **When** reviewed by developers, **Then** each issue includes a severity rating (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
3. **Given** the audit identifies issues, **When** reviewed, **Then** each issue includes a recommended fix aligned with new naming standards
4. **Given** the audit is complete, **When** presented to team, **Then** issues are prioritized by impact on developer productivity

### User Story 3 - Apply Cleanup Recommendations (Priority: P3)

As a developer, I need the project structure to conform to the documented standards so that I can navigate the codebase efficiently and contribute without confusion.

**Why this priority**: This operationalizes the standards from P1 using the roadmap from P2. Only after standards are established can cleanup be performed safely.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by verifying that all files identified in the audit now follow the naming conventions from constitution.md. Delivers value by creating a consistently organized codebase.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the audit identified Critical severity issues, **When** cleanup is performed, **Then** all Critical issues are resolved first
2. **Given** files need renaming, **When** cleanup is performed, **Then** all imports and references are updated accordingly
3. **Given** directories need reorganization, **When** cleanup is performed, **Then** no functionality is broken (verified by existing tests)
4. **Given** cleanup is complete, **When** re-audited, **Then** no Critical or High severity issues remain

### Edge Cases

- What happens when existing documentation files conflict with new naming standards (e.g., README.md vs readme.md)?
- How do we handle files that are imported across the codebase and would require extensive refactoring to rename?
- What happens when Git history becomes confusing due to file renames?
- How do we handle files that follow established Python conventions (e.g., `__init__.py`) vs our custom standards?
- What happens when SpecKit template files have their own naming conventions that differ from project conventions?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: Constitution.md MUST include a new "File Naming Standards" section documenting all naming conventions
- **FR-002**: File naming standards MUST cover: specification directories, documentation files, Python modules, test files, configuration files, and fixture files
- **FR-003**: Each naming rule MUST include: pattern description, format specification (e.g., kebab-case, snake_case), examples, and rationale
- **FR-004**: System MUST perform a comprehensive audit of current project structure identifying all deviations from established standards
- **FR-005**: Audit MUST categorize findings by severity: Critical (blocks productivity), High (creates confusion), Medium (aesthetic inconsistency), Low (minor deviation)
- **FR-006**: Each audit finding MUST include: file path, current naming pattern, recommended naming pattern, and migration complexity estimate
- **FR-007**: Cleanup implementation MUST process Critical and High severity issues first
- **FR-008**: Cleanup MUST preserve Git history where practical using `git mv` for tracked files
- **FR-009**: All file renames MUST update corresponding import statements and references
- **FR-010**: Cleanup MUST NOT break existing functionality (verified by running existing tests if available)

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Naming Convention Rule**: Represents a single naming standard with pattern, format, examples, and rationale
- **Audit Finding**: Represents a detected deviation from standards with file path, severity, current state, and recommended action
- **File Category**: Represents a type of file (specs, docs, tests, modules, config) with associated naming rules
- **Migration Task**: Represents a specific file rename or move operation with before/after paths and affected references

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Constitution.md contains complete file naming standards covering all file categories used in the project (specifications, documentation, modules, tests, configurations, fixtures)
- **SC-002**: All Critical and High severity naming inconsistencies are resolved (0 remaining after cleanup)
- **SC-003**: 100% of new files created after this feature comply with documented standards (measured via code review)
- **SC-004**: Developer can locate any file type in under 30 seconds using the documented structure and naming patterns
- **SC-005**: All existing tests continue to pass after file renaming operations (0 test failures introduced by cleanup)
- **SC-006**: Audit document provides actionable roadmap with severity ratings and estimated effort for each issue

## Assumptions *(mandatory)*

- The project follows Python conventions for package structure (using `__init__.py`, snake_case modules)
- SpecKit framework conventions (###-feature-name directories, spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md) are already standardized and should be documented but not changed
- Existing Git branches (001-feasibility-architecture, main) contain files that should not be modified on this branch
- The project uses English for file names and documentation (except for Korean sample email content)
- Standard configuration file names (pyproject.toml, Makefile, .env, .gitignore) follow ecosystem conventions and should not be renamed
- The project will continue using UV for Python dependency management (no need for alternative naming conventions)

## Out of Scope *(mandatory)*

- Changing SpecKit framework directory structure or template naming conventions
- Renaming configuration files that follow ecosystem standards (pyproject.toml, Makefile, etc.)
- Modifying files on other Git branches (only 002-structure-standards and potentially main)
- Creating automated linting rules to enforce naming conventions (may be a future feature)
- Reorganizing the fundamental architecture of the src/ directory (collabiq structure is already defined)
- Renaming Python standard files (__init__.py, __main__.py, etc.)
- Creating new tooling or scripts for automated file migration

## Dependencies *(if applicable)*

- Constitution.md version 1.0.0 exists and follows the established governance process for amendments
- Existing project structure is stable with no concurrent major reorganization efforts
- Git repository is clean with no uncommitted changes that could complicate file renames
- If tests exist, they must pass before cleanup begins to establish a baseline

## Risks & Mitigations *(if applicable)*

**Risk 1 - Breaking imports during file renames**
- **Likelihood**: Medium
- **Impact**: High (would break code execution)
- **Mitigation**: Perform thorough search for all import statements before renaming, use automated refactoring tools where possible, verify with tests

**Risk 2 - Git history becomes confusing after renames**
- **Likelihood**: High
- **Impact**: Medium (harder to trace file history)
- **Mitigation**: Use `git mv` for tracked files, document all renames in commit messages with before/after paths, keep renames in separate commits from content changes

**Risk 3 - Disagreement on naming conventions**
- **Likelihood**: Low
- **Impact**: Medium (delays implementation)
- **Mitigation**: Base conventions on established Python community standards (PEP 8) and existing SpecKit patterns, document rationale for each rule

**Risk 4 - Large-scale renames introduce merge conflicts**
- **Likelihood**: Medium
- **Impact**: Medium (harder to merge feature branches)
- **Mitigation**: Complete and merge this feature before other major branches are merged, coordinate with team on timing

## Notes *(optional)*

- The project is currently in early stages with only one completed feature branch (001-feasibility-architecture), making this an ideal time to establish standards before the codebase grows
- Some documentation files were recently relocated from specs/001-feasibility-architecture/ to docs/ and tests/fixtures/, indicating organic evolution of structure that now needs formalization
- The project uses both Korean and English content, but file names should remain English for cross-platform compatibility
- SpecKit framework already has well-defined conventions that should be documented but not modified (specs/###-feature-name/ structure)
- UV dependency manager and Python 3.12 are established standards that should be reflected in any tooling or configuration naming
