## Lessons Learned

### What Went Well ✅
1. **Strong Foundation**: Project was initialized with good naming practices from day 1
2. **Clear Research**: Thorough research phase identified all edge cases and boundaries
3. **Comprehensive Documentation**: Constitution.md provides clear guidance for all file types
4. **No Disruption**: Zero files needed renaming, avoiding import refactoring and merge conflicts
5. **Incremental Value**: P1 alone (documentation) provided immediate value even before audit

### Challenges Overcome 💪
1. **Documentation Boundary**: Clarified when to use SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE vs kebab-case
2. **SpecKit Integration**: Properly documented inherited framework conventions
3. **Ecosystem Standards**: Identified files that must never be renamed (README.md, pyproject.toml, etc.)

### Improvements for Future Features 🚀
1. **Proactive Standards**: Consider documenting standards early in project lifecycle
2. **Automated Linting**: Future enhancement could enforce naming via pre-commit hooks
3. **Template Updates**: Update project scaffolding templates to reflect standards

   git checkout main
   git merge 002-structure-standards
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Apply Standards Going Forward**:
   - Reference constitution.md during code reviews
   - Enforce naming in PR review checklist
   - Update onboarding documentation to point to standards

3. **Future Enhancements** (Optional):
   - Add pre-commit hooks for automated name checking
   - Create project scaffold templates with proper naming
   - Periodic re-audits (quarterly or before releases)

4. **Cleanup After Merge**:
   - Run `/speckit.cleanup` to remove `specs/002-structure-standards/`
   - Feature artifacts preserved in constitution.md and git history

## Conclusion

The 002-structure-standards feature successfully established comprehensive file naming conventions for the CollabIQ project. The audit revealed excellent pre-existing compliance (100%), demonstrating strong initial project setup. All three user stories were delivered, providing:

1. ✅ **P1 MVP**: Complete naming standards documentation
2. ✅ **P2 Analysis**: Comprehensive structure audit
3. ✅ **P3 Compliance**: Verification of zero violations
