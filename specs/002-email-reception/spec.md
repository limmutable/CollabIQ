# Feature Specification: Email Reception and Normalization

**Feature Branch**: `002-email-reception`
**Created**: 2025-10-30
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Phase 1a - Email Reception: Implement EmailReceiver component for ingesting emails from portfolioupdates@signite.co and ContentNormalizer for cleaning email text by removing signatures, quoted threads, and disclaimers"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

<!--
  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.
  
  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
  - Developed independently
  - Tested independently
  - Deployed independently
  - Demonstrated to users independently
-->

### User Story 1 - Receive and Store Raw Emails (Priority: P1)

As a CollabIQ system, I need to retrieve emails from the portfolioupdates@signite.co inbox so that collaboration activities can be processed.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundation for the entire system. Without reliable email ingestion, no collaboration tracking can occur. This is the entry point for all data.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by sending test emails to the inbox, verifying they are received, and checking that raw email content is stored in the output directory. Delivers the value of establishing the email ingestion pipeline.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the EmailReceiver is configured with valid credentials, **When** a new email arrives at portfolioupdates@signite.co, **Then** the email is retrieved within 5 minutes
2. **Given** multiple emails exist in the inbox, **When** EmailReceiver fetches emails, **Then** all unprocessed emails are retrieved in chronological order
3. **Given** an email has been successfully retrieved, **When** the email is saved, **Then** a raw email file is created in the output directory with timestamp and unique identifier
4. **Given** the email service is temporarily unavailable, **When** EmailReceiver attempts to connect, **Then** the system retries with exponential backoff and logs the failure

---

### User Story 2 - Remove Email Signatures (Priority: P2)

As a CollabIQ system, I need to remove email signatures from the email body so that only the collaboration content is extracted by the LLM.

**Why this priority**: Signatures add noise to LLM extraction and can confuse entity identification. Removing them improves extraction accuracy and reduces token costs.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by providing emails with common Korean and English signature patterns, running ContentNormalizer, and verifying signatures are removed while collaboration content remains intact.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an email contains a standard Korean signature (e.g., "감사합니다, [name]"), **When** ContentNormalizer processes the email, **Then** the signature is removed
2. **Given** an email contains an English signature with contact info, **When** ContentNormalizer processes the email, **Then** the signature block is removed
3. **Given** an email has a signature with company disclaimer text, **When** ContentNormalizer processes the email, **Then** both signature and disclaimer are removed
4. **Given** an email has no signature, **When** ContentNormalizer processes the email, **Then** the content remains unchanged

---

### User Story 3 - Remove Quoted Thread Content (Priority: P2)

As a CollabIQ system, I need to remove quoted email threads (previous conversations) so that only the new collaboration information is processed.

**Why this priority**: Quoted threads contain duplicate information from previous emails and can confuse LLM extraction or cause duplicate entries. Removing them ensures only new collaboration activity is captured.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by providing emails with quoted reply threads ("> " or "On [date], [person] wrote:"), running ContentNormalizer, and verifying quoted content is removed.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an email contains quoted text with "> " prefix, **When** ContentNormalizer processes the email, **Then** all quoted lines are removed
2. **Given** an email contains a "On [date], [person] wrote:" header followed by quoted text, **When** ContentNormalizer processes the email, **Then** the header and quoted content are removed
3. **Given** an email contains nested quoted threads (multiple levels), **When** ContentNormalizer processes the email, **Then** all nested quoted content is removed
4. **Given** an email is a fresh message with no quoted content, **When** ContentNormalizer processes the email, **Then** the content remains unchanged

---

### User Story 4 - Remove Disclaimers and Boilerplate (Priority: P3)

As a CollabIQ system, I need to remove legal disclaimers and boilerplate text so that LLM processing focuses on collaboration content.

**Why this priority**: Disclaimers are common in corporate emails but add no value to collaboration tracking. Removing them reduces token costs and improves extraction focus.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by providing emails with common disclaimer patterns, running ContentNormalizer, and verifying disclaimers are removed while collaboration content is preserved.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an email contains a confidentiality disclaimer at the bottom, **When** ContentNormalizer processes the email, **Then** the disclaimer is removed
2. **Given** an email contains an "This email is intended only for" notice, **When** ContentNormalizer processes the email, **Then** the notice is removed
3. **Given** an email contains both disclaimer and collaboration content, **When** ContentNormalizer processes the email, **Then** only the disclaimer is removed and collaboration content is preserved

### Edge Cases

- What happens when an email is completely composed of signature/disclaimer (no actual content)?
  - System should flag as empty content and skip LLM processing
- What happens when the email inbox is empty?
  - EmailReceiver should complete successfully with zero emails processed
- What happens when email credentials are invalid or expired?
  - System should fail fast with clear error message and not retry indefinitely
- What happens when an email contains Korean and English mixed content?
  - ContentNormalizer should detect and remove signatures/disclaimers in both languages
- What happens when signature patterns are non-standard or custom?
  - System should use heuristics (separator lines, contact info patterns) as fallback detection
- What happens when rate limits are hit on the email API?
  - System should respect rate limits and queue emails for later processing
- What happens if the same email is processed twice?
  - System should detect duplicates using message ID and skip reprocessing

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST connect to the portfolioupdates@signite.co inbox using configurable authentication method (IMAP, Gmail API, or webhook)
- **FR-002**: System MUST retrieve all unprocessed emails from the inbox in chronological order
- **FR-003**: System MUST save raw email content to file storage with timestamp and unique message identifier
- **FR-004**: System MUST detect and remove email signatures using pattern matching (Korean: "감사합니다", "드립니다", etc.; English: "Best regards", "Sincerely", etc.)
- **FR-005**: System MUST detect and remove quoted thread content identified by "> " prefix or "On [date]" headers
- **FR-006**: System MUST detect and remove legal disclaimers and confidentiality notices
- **FR-007**: System MUST preserve original collaboration content while removing noise (signatures, quotes, disclaimers)
- **FR-008**: System MUST output cleaned email text to file storage for downstream LLM processing
- **FR-009**: System MUST log all email processing activities (received, cleaned, skipped, failed) with timestamps
- **FR-010**: System MUST handle connection failures with exponential backoff retry logic (3 retries maximum)
- **FR-011**: System MUST detect duplicate emails using message ID and skip reprocessing
- **FR-012**: System MUST handle empty emails gracefully (no content after cleaning) and flag for review

### Key Entities

- **RawEmail**: Represents an unprocessed email retrieved from the inbox
  - Message ID (unique identifier)
  - Sender address
  - Subject line
  - Body (full text including signatures, quotes, disclaimers)
  - Received timestamp
  - Attachments (if any, stored separately)

- **CleanedEmail**: Represents a processed email with noise removed
  - Original message ID (links back to RawEmail)
  - Cleaned body text (collaboration content only)
  - Removed content summary (what was stripped out)
  - Processing timestamp
  - Cleaning success flag (true if content remains, false if completely empty)

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: System successfully retrieves and stores at least 90% of test emails sent to portfolioupdates@signite.co within 5 minutes of arrival
- **SC-002**: ContentNormalizer removes signatures from at least 95% of test emails while preserving all collaboration content
- **SC-003**: ContentNormalizer removes quoted thread content from at least 95% of test emails with reply chains
- **SC-004**: System handles connection failures gracefully with zero data loss (all emails eventually processed after retries)
- **SC-005**: Cleaned email files are ready for LLM processing (no signatures, quotes, or disclaimers remaining in manual spot-checks)
- **SC-006**: System processes 50 emails within 10 minutes (average 12 seconds per email including retrieval and cleaning)
- **SC-007**: Zero duplicate email entries are created when the same email is encountered multiple times

## Assumptions

- Email infrastructure approach (IMAP, Gmail API, or webhook) will be chosen based on existing T008 research findings
- The portfolioupdates@signite.co inbox receives primarily Korean and English emails
- Email volume is approximately 50 emails per day, with occasional spikes
- Signature patterns follow common Korean and English business email conventions
- Legal disclaimers use standard corporate language patterns
- System has write access to local file storage for raw and cleaned email files
- Email authentication credentials are provided via environment variables
- No real-time processing is required (5-minute polling interval is acceptable)

## Dependencies

- T008 research findings (email infrastructure selection: IMAP vs Gmail API vs webhook)
- Configuration management (`.env` file with email credentials)
- File system access for storing raw and cleaned email files
- Python email parsing libraries (email, imaplib, or google-api-python-client depending on T008 choice)

## Out of Scope

- Email sending/reply functionality (this is read-only ingestion)
- Attachment processing (Phase 1a focuses on text content only)
- LLM entity extraction (handled in Phase 1b)
- Notion database integration (handled in Phase 2)
- Manual verification UI (handled in Phase 3)
- Real-time webhook setup (if IMAP/Gmail API chosen, polling is acceptable)
- Email archiving or deletion from inbox (emails remain in inbox after processing)
- Multi-language support beyond Korean and English
