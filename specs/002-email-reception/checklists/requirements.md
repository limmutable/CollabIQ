# Specification Quality Checklist: Email Reception and Normalization

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-30
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Notes

### Content Quality
✅ **PASS** - Specification is technology-agnostic and focused on business needs. FR-001 mentions "IMAP, Gmail API, or webhook" but this is acceptable as it refers to infrastructure choices from existing T008 research, not implementation details.

### Requirement Completeness
✅ **PASS** - All requirements are testable and unambiguous:
- FR-001: Testable via connection test to portfolioupdates@signite.co
- FR-002: Testable by checking chronological order of retrieved emails
- FR-004-006: Testable by verifying specific patterns are removed
- FR-010: Testable by simulating connection failures and verifying retry behavior

### Success Criteria
✅ **PASS** - All success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic:
- SC-001: "90% of test emails within 5 minutes" - measurable time and percentage
- SC-002: "95% signature removal accuracy" - measurable percentage
- SC-006: "50 emails within 10 minutes" - measurable throughput

### Acceptance Scenarios
✅ **PASS** - All user stories have Given-When-Then scenarios covering:
- US1: Email retrieval (4 scenarios including error handling)
- US2: Signature removal (4 scenarios including edge cases)
- US3: Quoted thread removal (4 scenarios including nested quotes)
- US4: Disclaimer removal (3 scenarios)

### Edge Cases
✅ **PASS** - Comprehensive edge cases identified:
- Empty content after cleaning
- Empty inbox
- Invalid credentials
- Mixed language content
- Non-standard signatures
- Rate limiting
- Duplicate emails

### Scope
✅ **PASS** - Clear boundaries defined in Out of Scope section:
- No email sending/reply
- No attachment processing
- No LLM extraction (Phase 1b)
- No Notion integration (Phase 2)

## Overall Assessment

**Status**: ✅ **READY FOR PLANNING**

All checklist items pass. The specification is complete, unambiguous, and ready for `/speckit.plan`.

**Key Strengths**:
1. Clear prioritization with P1-P3 user stories
2. Comprehensive edge case coverage
3. Measurable success criteria aligned with roadmap targets (90%+ accuracy)
4. Well-defined scope boundaries

**No issues found** - Proceed to planning phase.
