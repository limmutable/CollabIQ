# Specification Quality Checklist: Gmail Setup for Production Email Access

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-11-01
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [X] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [X] Focused on user value and business needs
- [X] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [X] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [X] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [X] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [X] Success criteria are measurable
- [X] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [X] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [X] Edge cases are identified
- [X] Scope is clearly bounded
- [X] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [X] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [X] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [X] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [X] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Summary

**Status**: âœ… PASSED - Specification is complete and ready for planning

**Notes**:
- Specification focuses on setup and configuration rather than implementation
- All requirements are testable through documentation review and integration tests
- Success criteria are measurable (setup time, authentication success, test pass rate)
- No ambiguities or clarifications needed - the requirements are clear about:
  - Using OAuth2 for authentication (industry standard for Gmail API)
  - Accessing group alias through member accounts (documented Google Workspace behavior)
  - Storing credentials in Infisical or .env (leverages existing infrastructure)
- Edge cases identified cover authentication failures, token expiry, and network issues
- Scope is well-defined: configuration and documentation only, not new features

**Ready for**: `/speckit.plan` - Can proceed directly to planning phase
