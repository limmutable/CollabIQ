# Specification Quality Checklist: Infisical Secret Management Integration

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-11-01
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ **PASSED** - All checklist items complete

### Detailed Review:

#### Content Quality ✅
- Specification focuses on security outcomes (centralized secret storage, developer onboarding, secret rotation)
- No mention of specific Python libraries, code structure, or implementation approaches
- Written in business/user language about API key management, not technical jargon
- All mandatory sections present: User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria

#### Requirement Completeness ✅
- Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - all requirements are concrete
- All 13 functional requirements are testable (FR-001 through FR-013)
- Success criteria use measurable metrics (500ms, 99.9%, 10 minutes, 60 seconds)
- Success criteria focus on outcomes ("Zero credentials remain", "New developer onboarding completes") not technology
- 4 user stories with complete acceptance scenarios (Given-When-Then format)
- 7 edge cases identified covering failure scenarios
- Scope clearly bounded with "Out of Scope" section listing 10 excluded features
- Dependencies section lists 7 prerequisites, Assumptions section lists 9 assumptions

#### Feature Readiness ✅
- Each functional requirement maps to user story acceptance scenarios
- User scenarios prioritized (P1-P3) with independent test descriptions
- Success criteria directly relate to user stories (SC-001: migration, SC-005: onboarding, SC-006: rotation)
- No implementation leakage detected (e.g., no mention of specific Python SDK, class names, or code patterns)

## Notes

- Specification is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`
- No action items required before proceeding to next phase
- All validation criteria met on first pass
