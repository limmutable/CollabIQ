# Feature Specification: Infisical Secret Management Integration

**Feature Branch**: `003-infisical-secrets`
**Created**: 2025-11-01
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Advanced Secret Management - I'd like to use infisical secret management in this project. read https://infisical.com/docs/documentation/getting-started/overview, https://infisical.com/docs/cli/overview, https://infisical.com/docs/api-reference/overview/introduction, https://infisical.com/docs/sdks/overview, and https://github.com/Infisical/infisical to learn about infisical. create a spec to properly integrate the infisical into my project."

## User Scenarios & Testing

### User Story 1 - Secure API Key Storage (Priority: P1)

As a developer, I need all API keys (Gmail, Gemini, Notion) stored securely in a centralized secret management platform instead of local files, so that sensitive credentials are never committed to version control or exposed in logs.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundation of the security improvement. Without centralized secret storage, all other secret management features are impossible. It eliminates the highest security risk: hardcoded credentials in .env files.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by verifying that the application successfully retrieves secrets from Infisical and starts without requiring local .env files, and delivers immediate security value by removing credentials from the codebase.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** developer has configured Infisical credentials, **When** application starts, **Then** all API keys are fetched from Infisical and loaded into application configuration
2. **Given** Infisical is unreachable, **When** application starts, **Then** system falls back to cached secrets and logs a warning
3. **Given** no .env file exists locally, **When** application starts with Infisical configured, **Then** application successfully retrieves all required secrets and operates normally
4. **Given** a secret is updated in Infisical, **When** application restarts, **Then** application uses the updated secret value automatically

### User Story 2 - Developer Onboarding Without Manual Secret Sharing (Priority: P2)

As a new developer joining the team, I need to access project secrets through Infisical authentication instead of receiving credentials via email or Slack, so that I can start developing immediately without security risks from manual secret transfer.

**Why this priority**: Streamlines developer onboarding and eliminates the common security vulnerability of sharing secrets via insecure channels. Builds on P1 by adding team collaboration features.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by having a new developer authenticate with Infisical using their machine identity and successfully run the application without receiving any secrets from existing team members.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** new developer has Infisical access granted, **When** they authenticate with their machine identity, **Then** they receive all necessary secrets for the development environment
2. **Given** developer's access is revoked in Infisical, **When** they attempt to fetch secrets, **Then** authentication fails with a clear error message
3. **Given** developer needs different secrets for staging vs production, **When** they specify the environment, **Then** they receive only the secrets appropriate for that environment

---

### User Story 3 - Automated Secret Rotation (Priority: P3)

As a security administrator, I need the ability to rotate API keys in Infisical and have all running instances automatically pick up new values, so that compromised credentials can be invalidated quickly without manual updates across multiple environments.

**Why this priority**: Enhances long-term security posture but is not critical for initial deployment. Can be implemented after basic secret retrieval (P1) and team access (P2) are working.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by rotating a secret in Infisical and verifying that the application automatically detects and uses the new value within the cache TTL period without requiring restart.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a secret is rotated in Infisical, **When** cache expires (default 60 seconds), **Then** application automatically fetches and uses the new secret value
2. **Given** cache TTL is set to 5 minutes, **When** secret is updated, **Then** application continues using cached value for up to 5 minutes before refreshing
3. **Given** application is configured with cache disabled, **When** secret is rotated, **Then** next secret retrieval immediately returns the new value

---

### User Story 4 - Environment-Specific Secret Management (Priority: P2)

As a developer, I need different sets of secrets for development, staging, and production environments stored separately in Infisical, so that I never accidentally use production credentials in development and can safely test without impacting live systems.

**Why this priority**: Critical for safe development practices and preventing production incidents. Works alongside P1 and P2 to provide complete environment isolation.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by configuring different Infisical projects/environments and verifying that each environment only accesses its designated secrets.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** application is configured for development environment, **When** secrets are fetched, **Then** only development secrets are retrieved
2. **Given** developer attempts to access production secrets from development environment, **When** authentication is performed, **Then** access is denied with appropriate permissions error
3. **Given** secrets are organized by environment in Infisical, **When** configuration specifies environment slug, **Then** correct secret set is automatically selected

### Edge Cases

- What happens when Infisical service is temporarily unavailable during application startup?
- How does system handle authentication failure when machine identity credentials are invalid or expired?
- What occurs when a required secret is missing from Infisical but application expects it?
- How does application behave when cache is disabled and Infisical API is slow or rate-limited?
- What happens when developer switches between environments without updating machine identity?
- How does system handle partial secret updates (some secrets updated, others not)?
- What occurs when secret value format changes (e.g., JSON structure modified)?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST retrieve all API credentials (Gmail API, Gemini API, Notion API) from Infisical secret storage
- **FR-002**: System MUST support authentication using Universal Auth machine identities with client ID and client secret
- **FR-003**: System MUST cache retrieved secrets with configurable TTL (default: 60 seconds, minimum: 0 for disabled, maximum: 3600 seconds)
- **FR-004**: System MUST fall back to cached secrets when Infisical is temporarily unreachable
- **FR-005**: System MUST support environment-specific secret retrieval (development, staging, production) via environment slug parameter
- **FR-006**: System MUST validate that all required secrets are present before application initialization completes
- **FR-007**: System MUST log secret retrieval operations (success/failure) without logging secret values themselves
- **FR-008**: System MUST support secret refresh without application restart when cache expires
- **FR-009**: System MUST fail application startup with clear error message when required secrets are missing and no valid cache exists
- **FR-010**: System MUST integrate with existing Pydantic settings management without breaking backward compatibility with .env file configuration
- **FR-011**: System MUST support disabling Infisical integration via configuration flag for local development scenarios
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide configuration validation on startup to verify Infisical connectivity and permissions
- **FR-013**: System MUST handle secret value updates automatically when cache TTL expires without requiring code changes

### Key Entities

- **Secret**: Sensitive configuration value (API key, token, password) stored in Infisical with key-value pair structure, environment association, and optional metadata
- **Machine Identity**: Authentication credential set (client ID + client secret) used by application instances to authenticate with Infisical service
- **Environment**: Isolated namespace in Infisical (development, staging, production) containing environment-specific secret values
- **Project**: Infisical organizational unit grouping related secrets and environments with shared access policies
- **Secret Cache**: Local temporary storage of retrieved secrets with TTL-based expiration to reduce API calls and enable offline operation

## Success Criteria

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: All API credentials successfully migrate from .env files to Infisical within first deployment
- **SC-002**: Zero credentials remain in version control or .env files after Infisical integration is complete
- **SC-003**: Application startup time increases by no more than 500ms due to Infisical secret retrieval
- **SC-004**: Secret retrieval succeeds with 99.9% reliability using cache fallback mechanism
- **SC-005**: New developer onboarding completes in under 10 minutes without manual secret sharing
- **SC-006**: Secret rotation takes effect across all environments within maximum cache TTL (60 seconds default)
- **SC-007**: Zero production incidents caused by incorrect environment secrets after environment isolation is implemented

## Assumptions

- Infisical Cloud hosted service will be used initially (https://app.infisical.com) with option to migrate to self-hosted later
- Universal Auth with machine identities is the preferred authentication method over other options (AWS Auth, GCP Auth, OIDC)
- Python SDK (infisicalsdk package) is available and compatible with Python 3.12+
- Each environment (development, staging, production) will have separate Infisical projects or use environment slugs within a single project
- Developers will have access to Infisical credentials management UI for initial setup and troubleshooting
- Secret cache will use in-memory storage initially (can be enhanced with disk persistence later)
- Current .env file approach remains as fallback for developers who cannot access Infisical (e.g., offline development)
- Gmail API, Gemini API, and Notion API credentials are the primary secrets to be migrated
- Additional secrets (OAuth tokens, database credentials) may be added later using same pattern

## Out of Scope

- Self-hosted Infisical deployment (will use cloud service)
- Secret scanning of existing codebase for hardcoded credentials (can be added in future phase)
- Integration with CI/CD pipeline for automated secret injection during builds
- PKI/certificate management features of Infisical
- SSH access management features
- KMS encryption/decryption beyond basic secret storage
- Folder-based secret organization (flat namespace sufficient for MVP)
- Secret versioning and audit trail (available in Infisical but not required for MVP)
- Secret approval workflows (automatic secret retrieval sufficient for initial implementation)
- Integration with other secret management platforms (Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, etc.)

## Dependencies

- Active Infisical Cloud account or self-hosted instance
- Infisical project created with appropriate environments (dev, staging, prod)
- Machine identity credentials provisioned for each application instance
- Network connectivity to Infisical API endpoints (https://app.infisical.com/api)
- Python package `infisicalsdk` compatible with Python 3.12+
- Existing Pydantic settings configuration (src/config/settings.py)
- .env file structure documentation for secret migration mapping

## Risks

- **Infisical service availability**: Mitigated by cache fallback mechanism and .env file fallback option
- **Authentication credential compromise**: Mitigated by machine identity rotation capabilities and environment isolation
- **Network latency impact**: Mitigated by aggressive caching (60s default TTL) and local cache persistence
- **Learning curve for team**: Mitigated by comprehensive documentation and .env file fallback during transition
- **Migration complexity**: Mitigated by gradual rollout approach (optional flag to enable/disable Infisical)
- **Cost of Infisical service**: Free tier sufficient for initial deployment (5 users, unlimited secrets)
