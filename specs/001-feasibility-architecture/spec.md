# Feature Specification: CollabIQ System - Feasibility Study & Architectural Foundation

**Feature Branch**: `001-feasibility-architecture`
**Created**: 2025-10-28
**Status**: Draft - Foundational Analysis Phase
**Scope**: Feasibility study, technology assessment, architecture design, and implementation strategy for the full CollabIQ system

**Original Vision**: Email-based collaboration tracking system that extracts key entities (담당자, 스타트업명, 협업기관, 협업내용) from Korean/English emails sent to radar@signite.co, automatically creates entries in Notion "CollabIQ" database with proper relation mapping (fuzzy matching ≥0.85 confidence), classifies collaboration type ([A] PortCo×SSG, [B] Non-PortCo×SSG, [C] PortCo×PortCo, [D] Other) and intensity (이해/협력/투자/인수), generates 3-5 sentence summaries, validates required fields, handles low-confidence matches through verification queue, and produces periodic summary reports. Note: Uses a unified Company database (NOTION_DATABASE_ID_CORP) containing all startups, portfolio companies, and Shinsegate affiliates.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Feasibility Analysis & Technology Assessment (Priority: P1)

The development team needs to validate that the CollabIQ vision is technically feasible using **Gemini API as the primary NLP solution** with an abstraction layer that allows easy swapping or multi-LLM support in the future. This involves validating Gemini's Korean/English capabilities, Notion API compatibility, email processing infrastructure, and deployment architecture.

**Selected NLP Approach**: **Gemini API** (starting point)
- Excellent Korean understanding out-of-box (no training needed)
- Structured output capabilities (JSON schema enforcement)
- All-in-one processing (extraction + classification + summarization in single prompt)
- Cost: ~$15/month at 50 emails/day (Gemini 2.5 Flash)
- **Abstraction Layer Required**: Design LLM provider interface to allow swapping Gemini → GPT/Claude or multi-LLM orchestration later

**Why this priority**: Starting with Gemini avoids analysis paralysis from comparing multiple approaches. Focus is on validating Gemini meets ≥85% accuracy target and designing proper abstraction layer for future flexibility. If Gemini fails, abstraction layer makes it easy to swap providers.

**Independent Test**: Produce a feasibility report documenting: (1) Gemini API validation with Korean accuracy benchmarks on sample emails, (2) LLM abstraction layer design (interface for swapping providers), (3) Notion API rate limits and schema compatibility verification, (4) Email processing architecture options comparison, (5) Fuzzy matching algorithm selection with ≥0.85 threshold validation, (6) Go-no-go recommendation with risk assessment.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** requirement for Korean/English entity extraction, **When** team tests Gemini API on sample Korean collaboration emails, **Then** documents actual confidence scores, extraction accuracy (target ≥85%), cost per email, and latency
2. **Given** need for future flexibility, **When** architect designs LLM abstraction layer, **Then** produces interface definition (LLMProvider abstract class) with methods: extract_entities(), classify(), summarize(), allowing Gemini/GPT/Claude/multi-LLM implementations
3. **Given** Notion API integration requirements, **When** team reviews Notion API documentation and rate limits, **Then** validates all required field types are supported (Person, Relation, Select, Text, Date) and documents rate limit constraints (3 requests/second)
4. **Given** fuzzy matching requirement (≥0.85 similarity), **When** team evaluates matching approaches (LLM-based semantic matching vs traditional algorithms like Levenshtein, Jaro-Winkler), **Then** selects approach and validates threshold achieves acceptable precision/recall on Korean company names
5. **Given** email processing requirement (radar@signite.co), **When** team compares email infrastructure options (Gmail API, IMAP, email forwarding webhook), **Then** documents pros/cons and recommends approach with cost/complexity analysis
6. **Given** all technical components evaluated, **When** team assesses integration complexity and risk, **Then** produces go-no-go recommendation with identified technical blockers or mitigation strategies

### User Story 2 - System Architecture Design (Priority: P2)

Based on feasibility findings, design the overall system architecture including component boundaries, data flow, integration points, error handling strategy, and scalability approach. Architecture must support 50 emails/day initially with room to scale to 100+.

**Why this priority**: Once feasibility is confirmed, we need a clear architectural blueprint before writing any code. This prevents spaghetti code and ensures all components (email processor, entity extractor, Notion integrator, verification queue, reporting engine) have clean interfaces.

**Independent Test**: Produce architecture diagrams and documentation showing: (1) Component diagram with clear responsibilities, (2) Data flow diagram from email receipt to Notion creation, (3) API/interface contracts between components, (4) Error handling and retry logic, (5) Deployment architecture (serverless vs containers vs monolith).

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** feasibility study recommendations (Gemini API + abstraction layer), **When** architect designs component structure, **Then** produces component diagram showing separation of concerns: EmailReceiver, ContentNormalizer, **LLMProvider (abstraction layer)**, GeminiAdapter (implementation handling extraction + classification + summarization + fuzzy matching), NotionIntegrator, VerificationQueue, ReportGenerator
2. **Given** email-to-Notion workflow, **When** architect maps data flow, **Then** produces sequence diagram showing message passing, error paths, and retry logic for each step
3. **Given** need for testability and modularity, **When** architect defines interfaces, **Then** documents API contracts for each component with input/output schemas and error conditions, including **LLMProvider interface specification** (extract_entities, classify, summarize methods) enabling Gemini/GPT/Claude/multi-LLM implementations
4. **Given** requirement to handle Notion API failures, **When** architect designs error handling, **Then** specifies retry strategy (exponential backoff), local queue persistence, and dead letter queue for unrecoverable errors
5. **Given** 50 emails/day baseline with growth to 100+, **When** architect selects deployment model, **Then** compares options (AWS Lambda + SQS, containerized microservices, monolithic Python service) and recommends approach with scaling characteristics
6. **Given** verification queue requirement, **When** architect designs queue storage, **Then** specifies whether to use database table, Notion database itself, or separate queue service with rationale

### User Story 3 - Implementation Strategy & Phasing Plan (Priority: P3)

Define the step-by-step implementation roadmap that breaks the full CollabIQ system into manageable phases, each delivering incremental value. Strategy must align with MVP-first approach (P1 as minimal viable increment).

**Why this priority**: The full system is complex (10 processing steps, 4 classification rules, reporting analytics). Without a phased approach, we risk long development cycles without user feedback. This story creates the implementation roadmap that subsequent feature branches will follow.

**Independent Test**: Produce implementation phasing document showing: (1) Phase breakdown with deliverables per phase, (2) Dependency graph between phases, (3) MVP definition (what's the minimum to deliver value?), (4) Test strategy per phase, (5) Estimated complexity and timeline.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** full system requirements (24 functional requirements from original vision), **When** team defines MVP scope, **Then** identifies minimal feature set that delivers value (likely: email → entity extraction → manual Notion entry creation with extracted data)
2. **Given** identified MVP, **When** team plans Phase 1, **Then** defines specific deliverables: email ingestion working, entity extraction with confidence scores, output as structured JSON for manual review (no auto-Notion creation yet)
3. **Given** Phase 1 complete (extraction working), **When** team plans Phase 2, **Then** adds automatic Notion integration with hard-coded mapping (no fuzzy matching yet) to validate API integration
4. **Given** Phase 2 complete (Notion integration working), **When** team plans Phase 3, **Then** adds fuzzy matching and classification rules to reach production-quality automation
5. **Given** Phase 3 complete (automated pipeline working), **When** team plans Phase 4, **Then** adds verification queue and manual review interface for edge cases
6. **Given** Phase 4 complete (queue working), **When** team plans Phase 5, **Then** adds reporting and analytics features as final enhancement
7. **Given** phasing plan, **When** team documents testing strategy, **Then** specifies test approach per phase: Phase 1 (unit tests for extractors), Phase 2 (integration tests for Notion API), Phase 3 (accuracy tests for classifier), Phase 4 (UI tests for queue), Phase 5 (data quality tests for reports)

### User Story 4 - Technology Stack Selection & Project Setup (Priority: P4)

Based on architecture decisions, select specific technologies/libraries and set up the project scaffolding with proper structure, dependencies, configuration management, and development environment.

**Why this priority**: Once we have architecture and phasing plan, we need concrete technology choices and project structure before implementing Phase 1. This story delivers a working skeleton that subsequent phases build upon.

**Independent Test**: Produce working project repository with: (1) Selected tech stack documented in README, (2) Project structure matching architecture (folders for each component), (3) Dependencies installed and working (requirements.txt or equivalent), (4) Configuration management setup (.env, config files), (5) Development environment instructions, (6) CI/CD skeleton (linting, basic tests).

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** architecture design and feasibility findings, **When** team selects programming language, **Then** documents choice (likely Python for ML/NLP ecosystem, or Go for performance) with rationale
2. **Given** Korean NLP requirements, **When** team selects entity extraction library, **Then** installs and configures chosen library (e.g., KoNLPy + spaCy multilingual, or Stanza Korean model) with example working
3. **Given** Notion integration requirement, **When** team selects Notion client library, **Then** installs official Notion SDK and validates authentication working with test workspace
4. **Given** fuzzy matching requirement, **When** team selects string matching library, **Then** installs chosen library (e.g., RapidFuzz, FuzzyWuzzy, or jellyfish) and validates ≥0.85 threshold matching Korean names
5. **Given** email processing requirement, **When** team selects email infrastructure, **Then** sets up chosen approach (Gmail API credentials, IMAP config, or webhook endpoint) and validates test email reception
6. **Given** all dependencies, **When** team creates project structure, **Then** establishes folder hierarchy matching components: `src/email_receiver/`, `src/entity_extractor/`, `src/notion_integrator/`, `tests/`, `config/`, `docs/`
7. **Given** project structure, **When** team sets up configuration, **Then** creates `.env.example` with required variables (NOTION_API_KEY, EMAIL_CREDENTIALS, etc.) and loads config in main application
8. **Given** working skeleton, **When** team sets up CI/CD, **Then** configures GitHub Actions or equivalent with linting (ruff/black), type checking (mypy), and test execution on commit

### Edge Cases

- What if Gemini API fails to achieve ≥85% confidence on Korean text? The LLMProvider abstraction layer allows easy swapping to GPT-4 or Claude without rewriting the entire system. Alternatively, implement multi-LLM voting/consensus for higher accuracy at higher cost.
- What if Notion API rate limits (3 req/s) are insufficient for 50 emails/day? Calculate actual throughput requirements and design queuing/batching strategy to stay within limits.
- What if selected technology stack has licensing issues for commercial use? Evaluate alternative libraries or negotiate licensing before proceeding. Note: LLM APIs (Gemini, GPT, Claude) have commercial-friendly terms.
- What if email infrastructure (Gmail API) has prohibitive cost at scale? Compare with alternatives (IMAP self-hosted, SendGrid Inbound Parse, AWS SES) and switch if needed.
- What if architecture design reveals conflicting requirements (e.g., serverless incompatible with long-running NLP processing)? LLM API calls (1-3 second latency) fit well with serverless constraints compared to loading large NLP models (10-30 second cold start). Revise architecture accordingly.
- What if LLM API costs become prohibitive at scale? Calculate break-even point (e.g., at 500+ emails/day, self-hosted NLP may be cheaper). Design architecture to allow swapping NLP backend without rewriting entire system.
