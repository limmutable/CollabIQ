# Specification Quality Checklist: CollabIQ System - Feasibility Study & Architectural Foundation

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-28
**Updated**: 2025-10-28 (Refactored to foundational analysis scope)
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs) - Spec focuses on evaluating/selecting tech, not prescribing it
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs - Delivers technical foundation to enable subsequent feature development
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders - Explains what foundation work delivers (feasibility report, architecture, roadmap)
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous - Each FR specifies deliverable artifact (report, diagram, working code)
- [x] Success criteria are measurable - All SC have specific metrics (3 days for feasibility, ≥90% precision, 30min setup time)
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic - SC measure outcomes (report completion, accuracy achieved) not tools used
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined - 28 total scenarios across 4 user stories
- [x] Edge cases are identified - 5 edge cases covering technical blockers and constraints
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded - Limited to foundation work only; feature implementation deferred to future branches (002-xxx, 003-xxx)
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified - 10 assumptions documented including sample data availability, timeline, expertise

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria - 22 FRs map to acceptance scenarios in 4 user stories
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows - P1 (feasibility) → P2 (architecture) → P3 (phasing) → P4 (setup) forms complete foundation
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria - 12 success criteria align with 4 user story deliverables
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification - Mentions candidate technologies for evaluation, but doesn't prescribe choices

## Validation Summary

**Status**: ✅ PASSED - Specification is ready for planning phase

**Scope Clarification**:
This spec was refactored from a broad feature implementation spec to focus exclusively on **foundational analysis and setup work**. It does NOT implement the full CollabIQ system. Instead, it delivers:
1. **Feasibility study** answering "Can we build this?"
2. **Architecture design** answering "How should we build this?"
3. **Implementation roadmap** answering "What order should we build in?"
4. **Project scaffold** delivering "Working skeleton ready for Phase 1 implementation"

**Validation Details**:
- **Content Quality**: All items passed. Specification is analysis-focused with clear deliverables per user story.
- **Requirement Completeness**: All 22 functional requirements are testable (each produces a concrete artifact). No clarification markers needed.
- **Feature Readiness**: Four sequential user stories (P1→P2→P3→P4) form complete foundation. Each is independently testable and delivers incremental value.

**Key Strengths**:
- Clear separation between foundation work (this branch) and feature implementation (future branches)
- Each user story produces tangible artifacts (reports, diagrams, working code) that inform subsequent work
- Success criteria include time bounds (3 days for feasibility, 2 weeks for MVP) to prevent analysis paralysis
- Edge cases address common foundation pitfalls (technical blockers, rate limits, licensing issues)

**Ready for Next Phase**: `/speckit.plan` can proceed to generate:
- **research.md**: Technology evaluation findings (NLP libraries, Notion API, email options, fuzzy matching)
- **plan.md**: Architecture diagrams, component contracts, deployment strategy
- **data-model.md**: Entity schemas (though this spec focuses more on process than data)
- **contracts/**: API contracts between components
- **quickstart.md**: Development environment setup guide

## Notes

- **Scope Change**: Refactored from feature implementation to foundation analysis per user request
- This spec intentionally avoids implementation details while setting up framework for informed technology choices
- Subsequent feature branches (002-email-ingestion, 003-entity-extraction, etc.) will implement phases defined by this foundation work
- Foundation work is estimated at 2-3 weeks; feature implementation phases follow after
- Constitution Principle II compliance: P1 (feasibility) alone delivers value (go-no-go decision), subsequent stories build incrementally
