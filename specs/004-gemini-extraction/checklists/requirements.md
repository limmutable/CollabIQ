- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria

- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Notes

**Validation Pass 1** (2025-11-01):

### Content Quality Review
- ✅ **No implementation details**: Spec focuses on WHAT (extract 5 entities) and WHY (save 3-5 minutes per email), not HOW. Mentions Gemini/GeminiAdapter only in context of LLMProvider abstraction (FR-011, FR-012), which is acceptable as it's about interface design, not implementation.
- ✅ **User value focused**: Each user story clearly articulates time savings and value (P1: saves 3-5 minutes, P2: handles backlogs, P3: builds trust).
- ✅ **Non-technical language**: Uses business terms like "team member", "collaboration email", "manual review" rather than technical jargon.
- ✅ **Mandatory sections**: All present (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria).

### Requirement Completeness Review
- ✅ **No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]**: Zero markers present - all requirements are definitive.
- ✅ **Testable requirements**: Every FR has clear acceptance criteria:
  - FR-001: Can test by verifying 5 entities extracted
  - FR-002: Can test confidence scores are 0.0-1.0
  - FR-003: Can validate JSON output structure
  - FR-008: Can test with various date formats
- ✅ **Measurable success criteria**: All SC items have specific metrics:
  - SC-001/002: ≥85% accuracy on test datasets
  - SC-003: ≥90% calibration accuracy
  - SC-004: ≤5 seconds processing time
  - SC-006: ≤2 minutes per entry (vs 5-7 minutes baseline)
- ✅ **Technology-agnostic**: Success criteria describe user-facing outcomes, not system internals (e.g., "Team members can manually create Notion entries in ≤2 minutes" not "API response time < 200ms").
- ✅ **Acceptance scenarios**: 10 scenarios across 3 user stories, all in Given/When/Then format.
- ✅ **Edge cases**: 6 edge cases identified covering multi-event emails, forwarded content, language mixing, partial info, relative dates, HTML formatting.
- ✅ **Bounded scope**: Clear "Out of Scope" section defers 7 features to later phases.
- ✅ **Dependencies**: 4 dependencies listed (Phase 1a, Gemini API, Python env, config) and 8 assumptions documented.

### Feature Readiness Review
- ✅ **FR acceptance criteria**: Each FR is testable:
  - FR-001: Test by feeding sample email, verify 5 entities returned
  - FR-004: Test with email missing person_in_charge, verify null + confidence 0.0
  - FR-006: Test by simulating API failure, verify error status in JSON
- ✅ **Primary flows covered**: P1 (single email), P2 (batch), P3 (confidence review) cover all critical user journeys.
- ✅ **Measurable outcomes**: SC-001 through SC-007 align with FR-001 through FR-012 and user stories.
- ✅ **No implementation leakage**: Spec mentions "LLMProvider interface" and "GeminiAdapter" but only in context of abstraction layer (FR-011, FR-012), not implementation details. This is acceptable as it defines the architectural contract, not HOW it's coded.

## Overall Assessment

**Status**: ✅ **READY FOR PLANNING**

All checklist items pass. The specification is:
- Complete (all mandatory sections filled)
- Testable (every requirement has acceptance criteria)
- Measurable (all success criteria have metrics)
- Technology-agnostic (focuses on user outcomes, not system internals)
- Well-scoped (clear boundaries via Assumptions and Out of Scope)

**Next Step**: Proceed to `/speckit.plan` to generate implementation plan.
