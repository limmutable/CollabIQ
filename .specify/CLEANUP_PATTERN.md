# Speckit Cleanup Pattern Analysis

## Question
Should `/specs/feature_branch` directories be removed upon completion of implementation?

## Analysis Results

### Framework Documentation
After analyzing the speckit framework structure in `.specify/`:

1. **constitution.md**: Defines feature lifecycle (Specification → Planning → Implementation → Merge) but does NOT mention cleanup of specs directories
2. **create-new-feature.sh**: Creates `specs/$BRANCH_NAME` directories but has no removal logic
3. **update-agent-context.sh**: Manages agent context files and includes cleanup() for temp files only
4. **No explicit cleanup commands**: Framework does not include archive/cleanup scripts for specs directories

### Observed Practice
During 001-feasibility-architecture feature completion:
- All implementation artifacts were preserved by copying to `docs/` directory
- Important findings documented in permanent locations (README.md, docs/)
- After merge to main, `specs/001-feasibility-architecture/` was removed manually
- User comment: "speckit does this everytime I complete the spec implementation"

### Conclusion
**Recommended Pattern**: Manual cleanup of specs directories after implementation completion

**Cleanup Checklist**:
1. ✅ Verify all acceptance criteria met
2. ✅ Copy important artifacts to `docs/` directory
3. ✅ Update README.md with completion status
4. ✅ Merge feature branch to main
5. ✅ Remove `specs/feature_branch/` directory
6. ✅ Commit cleanup changes

**Rationale**:
- Specs directories are working documents for active development
- After merge, the implementation itself becomes the source of truth
- Important findings should be preserved in permanent documentation
- Removing specs directories keeps the repository clean and focused on current work
- This is a convention rather than an enforced rule in the framework

## Example Commands
```bash
# After successful merge and artifact preservation
rm -rf specs/001-feasibility-architecture
git add specs/
git commit -m "Clean up completed feature spec directory"
git push
```

## Future Enhancement Consideration
Could add a cleanup script to `.specify/scripts/bash/` like:
- `archive-completed-feature.sh` - Copy artifacts to docs/ and remove specs directory
- Or add cleanup step to the feature completion workflow

For now, manual cleanup following the checklist above is the established pattern.
