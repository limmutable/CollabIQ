# CollabIQ Documentation

Welcome to the CollabIQ documentation. This guide will help you navigate all available resources.

## Getting Started

If you're new to CollabIQ, start here:

- [Quick Start Guide](setup/quickstart.md) - Set up your development environment in under 15 minutes

## Architecture & Design

Learn about the system design and implementation strategy:

- [System Architecture](architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md) - Component design, data flow, deployment architecture
- [API Contracts](architecture/API_CONTRACTS.md) - Interface specifications for all components
- [Implementation Roadmap](architecture/ROADMAP.md) - 12-phase development plan with progress tracking

## Validation Results

Review the feasibility testing and API validation results:

- [Notion API Validation](validation/NOTION_API_VALIDATION.md) - Comprehensive Notion API test results
- [Notion Schema Analysis](validation/NOTION_SCHEMA_ANALYSIS.md) - Database field structures and types

## Project Status
