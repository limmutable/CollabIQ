## Phase 0 Documentation (October-November 2025)

Located in [`phase0/`](phase0/)

These documents were created during the initial feasibility study and foundation work (Phase 0) of the CollabIQ project. They served their purpose during early development but are now outdated as the MVP is complete.

### Why Archived?

- **Decision Made**: Feasibility testing complete, decisions finalized
- **Work Complete**: Foundation work finished, MVP implemented
- **Historical Value**: Preserved for understanding past decisions and research

### Archived Files
