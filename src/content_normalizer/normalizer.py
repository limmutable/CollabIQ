    Email text cleaning component that removes signatures, quoted threads, and disclaimers.

    Uses pattern-based detection with Korean and English regex patterns.

    Requirements Coverage:
    - FR-004: Detect and remove email signatures (Korean: "감사합니다", "드립니다"; English: "Best regards")
    - FR-005: Detect and remove quoted thread content ("> " prefix, "On [date]" headers)
    - FR-006: Detect and remove legal disclaimers and confidentiality notices
    - FR-007: Preserve original collaboration content while removing noise
    - FR-008: Output cleaned email text to file storage
    - FR-012: Handle empty emails gracefully (flag for review)
    - SC-002: Remove signatures from 95%+ of test emails
    - SC-003: Remove quoted threads from 95%+ of test emails
